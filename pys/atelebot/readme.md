## A Simple Telegram Chat Bot with Gemini Inside

Demo: [@wygemibot](https://t.me/wygemibot)

## Usage

### Install requirements

```cmd
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Run Locally

```cmd
python main.py --key {your google api key} --token {bot token} --botname {botname} --webhook {webhook url}
```

#### Parameters

1. `--key`: Required. Google gemini api key, can apply from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. `--token`: Required. Telegram bot token, get it from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
3. `--botname`: Required. Your botname, get it from **BotFather** or bot info page <username>,
   start with`@`, `@mybot` for example.
4. `--webhook`: Optional. Set it to run telegram bot in webhook mode, or in polling mode.

#### Additional

1. You need set proxy to make telegram and gemini connect to server successfully. You can find a
   named `set_local_proxy` method in `bconf.py`, run it before start bot in `main.py`

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        bconf.set_local_proxies()
        asyncio.run(init_bot())
    ```

2. If you want to run bot in webhook mode locally, you may need extra tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
   to proxy your `localhost:port` to a public https link.

### Run with Docker

#### Build image

```cmd
docker build -t image:tag .
```

#### Run Image

```cmd
docker run -d --network host \
-e API_KEY=gemini_api_key \
-e BOT_TOKEN=bot_token \
-e BOT_NAME=bot_name \
-e WEB_HOOK=web_hook_url \
image:tag
```

## Deploy

### Deploy on pythonanywhere

[pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) is a provider offers free cloud resources to host and your python codes.

Using pythonanywhere, your bot can run in polling mode. And it's simple to deploy.

Upload all project files, install requirements and run `python main.py` -h for help.

Just same as run in local machine.

### Deploy on koyeb

[koyeb](https://app.koyeb.com/) offers free limited resource to host your web app, which is enough to host this bot.

By using koyeb, bot must run in webhook mode.

You can deploy this project as web-service by docker or github.

Key configurations:

1. source: your image docker hub path/your github repository
2. environment variables:
   1) API_KEY=gemini_api_key
   2) BOT_TOKEN=bot_token
   3) BOT_NAME=bot_name
   4) WEB_HOOK=web_hook_url
3. configure ports: 8443

Build your own docker image to deploy with docker.

The easier way is build from github repository. 2 things need to do before build from github:

1. [fork](https://github.com/wangy325/snipy/fork) this repo
2. install [gitPull](https://github.com/apps/pull) to sync updates

If you are the first time deploying, do as page instruction. And do not
forget to set `Work directory` as `./pys/atelebot`.

Your webhook url of koyeb is like `https://beauty-girl-7xhd16532.koyeb.app`, which is auto generated once service created.

Below is a deploy link(demo):

Configure the repository/source and branch properly and set environment variables correctly, then deploy.
