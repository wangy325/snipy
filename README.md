### About

This repository holds snippets of code in Java, Python, and more.

Mostly these are practice exercises from my learning journey, with some going as far back as 2018 â€“ pretty funny to think about!

I keep these snippets to document my coding experience and for quick reference to language specifics.

### Visualization

In the pre-personal blog era, all notes were written in Markdown within projects. As files accumulated, 
finding specific information became increasingly challenging.

To address this, I integrated the repository as a submodule into my personal blog.

By treating the repository as a submodule, code snippets become assets of the Hugo blog site.

Simple code snippets, easily encapsulated in a single source code file, can be readily transformed into 
individual blog pages using Hugo's built-in templates.

More complex snippets, while requiring more effort, can still be incorporated into blog pages through Hugo's shortcodes
